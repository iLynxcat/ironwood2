# the rules

just because ironwood is ephemeral does not mean that it's free reign. please
follow just a few rules, enumerated below.

1. **post nothing illegal.** this includes anything illegal in the jurisdiction
   you are posting from, and where ironwood is hosted (United States).

2. **act decent.** this will be enforced relatively loosely, but don't be a
   complete asshole to other people on ironwood.

3. **keep it PG-13.** we don't have the rule enforcement capacity right now to
   moderate 18+ content. this may get lifted in the future.

4. **ironwood admins may enforce and codify other rules.** we can't see into the
   future â€” if something happens that's not against these rules but we deem it
   should be, we reserve the right to enforce it and add it to the rules.
